# Online-Shoppers-Purchase-Prediction
In my recent project, I developed a predictive model to determine whether an online shopping session will lead to a purchase, using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project focuses on enhancing e-commerce strategies by leveraging machine learning to better understand and predict customer behaviour.
The dataset includes 18 features, capturing various user behaviours such as page visit duration and bounce rates. After performing extensive data preprocessing—such as handling duplicates, outliers, and normalizing features—I applied multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGB, AdaBoost, CatBoost, Extra Trees, Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN), Combination of Ensemble methods and Hybrid model (FNN, Ensemble methods and metal-model).
Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, I utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to ensure that the model could effectively predict the minority class—purchasing sessions. I evaluated each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
The Extra Trees model, an ensemble learning technique, emerged as the top performer with a 95% accuracy, 97% recall, and a robust F1 score of 95%. This model was particularly effective in distinguishing between purchasing and non-purchasing sessions, offering significant practical value for e-commerce platforms.
By implementing this model, businesses can improve targeted marketing efforts, increase conversion rates, and maximize ROI by focusing on users most likely to make a purchase. This project highlights the power of machine learning in driving smarter, data-driven decisions in the e-commerce sector.
